# 🧠 Claude Code Best Practices

A practical guide to using Claude Code, Anthropic’s agentic coding assistant, effectively in real-world development workflows. This repo distills best practices, patterns, and examples for integrating Claude Code into your terminal-based coding environment.

## ✨ What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a command-line tool that gives you direct access to Claude’s reasoning and coding capabilities. It’s designed for agentic coding - where Claude autonomously explores, edits, and explains code across your project. Think of it as a collaborative AI pair programmer that understands your repo structure, coding conventions, and workflows.
